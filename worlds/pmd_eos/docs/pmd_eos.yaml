# Q. What is this file?
# A. This file contains options which allow you to configure your multiworld experience while allowing
#    others to play how they want as well.
#
# Q. How do I use it?
# A. The options in this file are weighted. This means the higher number you assign to a value, the
#    more chances you have for that option to be chosen. For example, an option like this:
#
#    map_shuffle:
#      on: 5
#      off: 15
#
#    Means you have 5 chances for map shuffle to occur, and 15 chances for map shuffle to be turned
#    off.
#
# Q. I've never seen a file like this before. What characters am I allowed to use?
# A. This is a .yaml file. You are allowed to use most characters.
#    To test if your yaml is valid or not, you can use this website:
#        http://www.yamllint.com/
#    You can also verify that your Archipelago options are valid at this site:
#        https://archipelago.gg/check

# Your name in-game, limited to 16 characters.
#     {player} will be replaced with the player's slot number.
#     {PLAYER} will be replaced with the player's slot number, if that slot number is greater than 1.
#     {number} will be replaced with the counter value of the name.
#     {NUMBER} will be replaced with the counter value of the name, if the counter value is greater than 1.

# Used to describe your yaml. Useful if you have multiple files.
